<h2> What Causes Poor Time Management </h2>
<p> Time management  is the ability to plan and control how someone spends the hours in a day to effectively accomplish their goals. People who have poor time management don’t do that. Those people end up letting tasks sit all the way until the last minute. Last minute activities make people feel more pressured and stressed out. That causes them to rush through things and give a poor quality of work or even miss deadlines. With a continuous cycle of poor quality, their productivity starts to slowly decline, causing a drastic shift in their time management. People start to procrastinate, be less organized, fail to focus on priorities, etc. </p>
